# MY JANTES Flutter Application

## Overview

MY JANTES is a comprehensive Flutter mobile application for a specialized aluminum wheel renovation service based in Liévin, France. The app provides a complete customer experience with online booking, quote requests with photo uploads, and an admin dashboard for business management. The application supports multiple platforms (iOS, Android, and Web) and is designed for deployment through Codemagic CI/CD with various distribution channels including Google Play Store, TestApp.io for iOS testing, and web hosting on Hostinger.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a standard Flutter architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Main Entry Point**: Single `main.dart` file bootstraps the app with MaterialApp configuration
- **Screen-Based Navigation**: Separate screen widgets for home, booking, quotes, admin dashboard, and legal pages
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for managing application state and user authentication
- **Service Layer**: Dedicated services for API communication and authentication logic
- **Model Layer**: Data models for bookings, quotes, and user management
- **Theme System**: Centralized theme configuration with MY JANTES branding (red #DC2626, Roboto fonts)

The app implements Material Design 3 principles with custom theming to match the brand identity. The responsive design adapts to mobile, tablet, and web viewport sizes.

### Backend Integration
The Flutter app integrates with a WordPress backend through REST API endpoints:

- **API Service**: HTTP client wrapper for WordPress REST API communication
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based authentication for admin access
- **File Upload**: Image upload functionality for quote requests with photo attachments
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences for caching user preferences and authentication tokens

### Platform-Specific Configurations

**Android Configuration**:
- Bundle identifier: `fr.myjantes.app`
- Configured for both APK distribution and Google Play Store app bundles
- Keystore signing setup for production releases

**iOS Configuration**: 
- Bundle identifier: `fr.myjantes.app`
- Configured for ad-hoc distribution through TestApp.io (avoiding Apple Developer account requirement)
- Standard iOS project structure with proper xcodeproj setup

**Web Configuration**:
- Progressive Web App (PWA) ready with manifest.json
- Optimized for deployment on Hostinger hosting
- SEO-friendly with proper meta tags and Open Graph configuration

### CI/CD Architecture
The project uses Codemagic for automated builds and deployment:

- **Multi-platform Builds**: Separate workflows for Android, iOS, and Web
- **Automated Signing**: Keystore management for Android releases
- **Artifact Distribution**: Automated upload to various distribution channels
- **Environment Management**: Separate configurations for development and production
